# Welcome to the R Dev Container

If you haven't seen them yet, you can find the [R Dev Container
Docs](https://contributor.r-project.org/r-dev-env/) online.

This index links to underlying markdown files for key sections of the docs, so
you can preview them right here in VS Code.

## Working with the container

The links below give more information on using the container via GitHub
Codespaces or Gitpod Workspaces.  Take a moment to review how to stop and
restart your container, so you can continue your work.  If you are collaborating
with others, you may want to use Live Share so that you can share the same
workspace.

### Github Codespace

- [Stopping and Restarting
  Codespace](docs/container_setup/github_codespace/codespacestartstop.md)
- [Collaborating with Live
  Share](docs/container_setup/github_codespace/live_share.md)

### Gitpod Workspace

- [Stopping and Restarting
  Codespace](docs/container_setup/gitpod_workspace/workspacestop_and_restart.md)
- [Collaborating with Live
  Share](docs/container_setup/gitpod_workspace/live_share.md)

## Tutorials

Learn how to use the container with these mini tutorials.  If you have used R in
VSCode before, you can skip Tutorial 1.  Tutorials 2 and 3 are the minimum to
get started with R development.  You can run through these in about 30 minutes.
You can refer to the remaining sections as needed!

1. [Running R](docs/tutorials/running_r.md)
2. [Building R](docs/tutorials/building_r.md)
3. [R Contribution Workflow](docs/tutorials/contribution_workflow.md)
