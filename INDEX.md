# Welcome to the R Dev Container!

If you haven't seen them yet, you can find the
[R Dev Container Docs](https://contributor.r-project.org/r-dev-env/) online.

This index links to underlying markdown files for key sections of the docs, so you can preview them right here in VS Code. 

## Working with the container

The links below give more information on using the container via GitHub Codespaces or Gitpod Workspaces.
Take a moment to review how to stop and restart your container, so you can continue your work.
If you are collaborating with others, you may want to use Live Share so that you can share the same workspace.

### Github Codespace

- [Restarting and Stopping Codespace](docs/container_setup/github_codespace/codespacestartstop.md)
- [Collaborating with Live Share](docs/container_setup/github_codespace/live_share.md)

### Gitpod Workspace

- [Restarting and Stopping Workspace](docs/container_setup/gitpod_workspace/workspacestop_and_restart.md)
- [Collaborating with Live Share](docs/container_setup/gitpod_workspace/live_share.md)
