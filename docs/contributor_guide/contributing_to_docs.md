Contributing to documentation helps improve the project and makes it more accessible. Follow these steps to set up your environment, edit content, and preview changes locally.

#### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository
-   Fork the [r-dev-env repository](https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-env) on GitHub and clone it to your local machine.
 

#### 2. Change to the Project Directory
-   Navigate to the r-dev-env directory where the project is located.

#### 3. Create a Virtual Environment
-   Set up a Python virtual environment using the venv module.
```
python3 -m venv venv
```

#### 4. Activate the Virtual Environment
-   Activate the virtual environment to isolate dependencies.
```
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

#### 5. Install MkDocs and Dependencies
-   Install MkDocs and its required libraries, including mkdocs-material.
```
pip install mkdocs "mkdocs-material[imaging]"
```

#### 6. Navigate to the Project Root
-   After setting up the virtual environment and installing necessary libraries, navigate to the root directory of the project where the `mkdocs.yml` file is located.

#### 7. Start the Local Development Server
-   To start the local development server and preview changes, run the following command:
```
mkdocs serve
```
This will compile the documentation and serve it locally. You can access the documentation by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8000.

#### 8. Edit Documentation
-    Make changes to the documentation content files located in the `docs` directory. You can use Markdown syntax for formatting.

#### 9. Preview Changes
-    As you make changes, the local development server will automatically detect them and update the preview in real-time. Refresh your browser to see the changes.

**N.B.** There is a known issue with mkdocs not alwayds finding Cairo. The issue and suggested fixes are on the [MkDocs Image Processing](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/requirements/image-processing/) page.
