While working with an R Dev Container, you may encounter some known errors. Here
are a few common ones:

1. #### Error: Rsync Connection Limit Reached, Preventing New Connections

    **Description :** When attempting to use rsync, you may encounter the
    following error message:

    ```bash
    $TOP_SRCDIR/tools/rsync-recommended @ERROR: max connections (59) reached -- try again later rsync error: error starting client-server protocol (code 5) at main.c(1863) [Receiver=3.2.7] *** rsync failed to update Recommended files ***
    ```

    **Cause :** This error occurs because the rsync server has reached its
    maximum allowed number of simultaneous connections, which is set to 59. As a
    result, new connection attempts are rejected until some of the existing
    connections are closed.

    **Solutions :**
    1. Retry After Some Time : Wait for a few minutes and try running the rsync
       command again. The number of active connections may decrease, allowing
       you to connect.
    2. Restart Codespace : Sometimes, simply restarting your Codespace can
       resolve temporary connection issues. Try restarting your Codespace and
       then attempt the rsync command again.
