The [Building R](./building_r.md) and [R Contribution Workflow](./building_r.md) 
tutorials use the simplest set up, working on a single copy of the R sources.

It can be helpful to work with multiple versions of R:

-   to compare your modifications with an unmodified copy, e.g. to
    compare speed or memory usage, or
-   to work on independent changes, so that each patch only contains the
    changes for one bug fix or new feature.

You can build multiple R versions in the same Codespaces environment. To do so, follow these steps:

#### 1. Choose a name for the R version
-   First choose a name for the R version. This will be used to identify
    the version and to name the build/source directory. By default, we
    use the name `r-devel` and the environment variables `BUILDDIR` and
    `TOP_SRCDIR` are set to match.

    For illustration, we will use `r-devel-raw`, which you might use to
    name a version of R that you never modify.

#### 2.  Set Environment variables
-   You can set the `BUILDDIR` and `TOP_SRCDIR` environment variables to
    match your chosen name using the `set_build_r` function:

    -   Open a terminal in the codespace.

    -   Run the `set_build_r` function with your chosen name as the argument, e.g.

        ```         
        set_build_r r-devel-raw
        ```

        The new values of the environment variables will be printed as confirmation:

        ```         
        BUILDDIR is now set to /workspaces/r-dev-env/build/r-devel-raw
        TOP_SRCDIR is now set to /workspaces/r-dev-env/svn/r-devel-raw
        ```
        
#### 3.  Copy or build source
-   If you have an unmodified build of R-devel using the default name of
    `r-devel`, you can simply copy the sources and the build to the new
    directories with `rsync`:

    ```         
    rsync -a "$(dirname "$BUILDDIR")/r-devel/"* $BUILDDIR
    rsync -a "$(dirname "$TOP_SRCDIR")/r-devel/"* $TOP_SRCDIR
    ```

    Otherwise you can follow the steps in the [Building R](./building_r.md)
    tutorial to checkout the R sources and build R using the new source and
    build directories.

#### 4.  Select R version
-   Once you have a build of R under the new build directory, you will
    see your chosen name in the choices when running the `which_r` script to 
    select the version of R to run in new terminals, e.g.

    ```         
    which_r
    ```

    ```  
    Which version of R should be used in new R terminals?
      1. R 4.4.0 (release version built into this container)
      Additional R builds available:
        2. r-devel
        3. r-devel-raw
    Enter the number corresponding to the selected version: 
    ```

!!! Note

    `BUILDDIR` and `TOP_SRCDIR` will be set to the defaults using the label `r-devel` 
    whenever a new bash terminal is opened, e.g. when the codespace is restarted.
    
    Whenever following instructions that use these variables to refer to the build 
    and source directory, be sure they are pointing to the desired version! 
    
    You can check the values any time with 
    
    ```
    echo $BUILDDIR
    echo $TOP_SRCDIR
    ```
    
    and switch with `set_build_r <name>`.
