#### 1. Example Contribution Workflow using the R Dev Container

- To start working in R we will click on `R:(not attach)` which is in the bottom
  right of the VSCode window. This will open an R terminal for us.

- We can now run R commands. We will use the `utils::askYesNo()` function as an
  example

    ![alt text](../assets/rdev19.png)

```Rconsole
    > askYesNo("Is this a good example?")
    Is this a good example? (Yes/no/cancel) Yes
    [1] TRUE
```

#### 2. Editing Source Code

- Edit the source code of `utils::askYesNo()` to change the default options. The
  source code can be found in `$TOP_SRCDIR/src/library/utils/R/askYesNo.R`.
- You can redirect to that file using

```bash
code $TOP_SRCDIR/src/library/utils/R/askYesNo.R
```

**> Before edit:** ![alt text](../assets/rdev20.png)

```R title="askYesNo.R" linenums="20"
    prompts = getOption("askYesNo", gettext(c("Yes", "No", "Cancel"))),
```

**> With edit (for example - change to whatever you like!):**

![alt text](../assets/rdev21.png)

```R title="askYesNo.R" linenums="20"
    prompts = getOption("askYesNo", gettext(c("Oh yeah!", "Don't think so", "Cancel"))),
```

#### 3. Rebuild R

- We can re-build R with our changes. Since we have only modified the utils
  package, rebuilding R will only re-build the utils package.
- First we need to be inside $BUILDDIR.
- Quit R with `q()` or by closing the R terminal.
- In the bash terminal, change to the build directory:

```bash
cd $BUILDDIR
```

- Now run the `make` command to rebuild R with the changes you made in
  step 2. This will be much faster than the full build!

```bash
make
```

![alt text](../assets/rdev22.png)

- Optionally run `make check` to run R's test suite with your local changes. You
  may skip this step while you are iterating on a bug fix or other development,
  until you are ready to [create a patch](./patch_update.md).

- To use the re-built R, simply open a new R terminal.

#### 4. Cross check and Re-running Code

- Check the edit has worked as expected by re-running the example code: ![alt
text](../assets/rdev23.png)

```R
    > askYesNo("Is this a good example?")
    Is this a good example? (Yes/no/cancel) Yes
    [1] TRUE
```
