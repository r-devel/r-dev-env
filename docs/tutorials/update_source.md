The R Core Team commit changes to the development version of R sometimes
multiple times a day. It's a good idea to update your local copy of the source
code from time to time, especially before creating a patch. To do so, follow
these steps:

#### 1) Close R terminal

If you have an R terminal open, quit R or close the terminal.

#### 2) Go to the source directory

In a bash terminal, change to the source directory

```bash
cd $TOP_SRCDIR
```

#### 3) Review local changes

Use the Subversion diff command to review changes you have made to source code

```bash
svn diff
```

#### 4) Revert changes (optional)

If you no longer want to keep your local changes, you can revert them.

Revert the changes made in specific file

```bash
svn revert src/library/utils/R/askYesNo.R
```

Revert changes in a directory

```bash
svn revert src/lib/utils
```

Revert all local changes

```bash
svn revert -R .
```

#### 5) Rebuild and check with any local changes

If you have no local changes remaining, skip to the next step.

Otherwise, go to the build directory to build and check R with your local
changes.

```bash
cd $BUILDDIR
make
make check
```

If the check fails with an error, you have broken something with your local
changes. Fix this before proceeding. Otherwise go back to the source directory
to continue

```bash
cd $TOP_SRCDIR
```

#### 6) Update using svn

Use the Subversion command `update` to update your local copy with the latest
changes by the R Core Team.

```bash
svn update
```

#### 7)  Rebuild and check with the updates

To rebuild R with the latest changes from the R Core Team and any local changes
you have kept, go to the build directory to build and check R

```bash
cd $BUILDDIR
make
make check
```

If the check fails, this will be due to recent changes made by the R Core
Team. See [SVN Help](./svn_help.md) for how to revert to a version that passes
check.
