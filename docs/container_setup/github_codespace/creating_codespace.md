!!! Note "About Codespace Billing"
    You will see "Codespace usage for this repository is paid for by [user]".
    Don't worry!

    - GitHub Codespaces: 120 core hours free per month
    - Free hours = 120 / number of cores
    - Default: 4 cores = 30 hours free per month
    - Core count can be adjusted
