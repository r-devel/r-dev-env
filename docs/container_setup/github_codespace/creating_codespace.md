!!! Note "About Codespace Billing"
    You will see the message "Codespace usage for this repository is paid for by [your username]". Don't worry!

    - GitHub Codespaces offers 120 core hours of free usage per month for every GitHub user
    - The actual free hours = 120 / number of cores used
    - The r-dev-env codespace uses 4 cores by default = 30 hours free usage per month
    - You can adjust the core count based on your needs
