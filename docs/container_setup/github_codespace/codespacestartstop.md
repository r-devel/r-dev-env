#### Idle timeout

If you do not interact with the codespace, it will close automatically when it
reaches the idle timeout limit. By default, this is 30 minutes, but you can [set
a personal
timeout](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-your-user-preferences/setting-your-timeout-period-for-github-codespaces#setting-your-default-timeout-period)
limit in your GitHub settings.

The code changes and operations we have performed inside the codespace will
still be inside the stopped codespace. If your codespace is stopped then you can
restart it as shown below.

#### How to Restart Codespaces again?

- Go to [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)
- Here we can see a list of the codespaces we have created ![stop
  codespace](../../assets/rdev17.png)
- To restart it, we can just click on the codespaces we wanted to use and it
  will start the codespaces again for us.
- You can also see an active label added to the codespaces we just started

#### Managing and Sustaining Codespaces

##### Setting a Default Retention Period for Your Codespaces

**Access Settings:**

- Click your profile photo in the upper-right corner of any GitHub page.
- Click "Settings."

**Navigate to Codespaces Settings:**

- In the sidebar, under "Code, planning, and automation," click "Codespaces."

**Set Retention Period:**

- Under "Default retention period," enter the number of days (between 0 and 30)
for which you want your codespaces to be retained after they have been stopped.
Example: Setting it to 30 days.  ![retain
codespace](../../assets/manage_codespace.png)

**Warning:**

- Setting the retention period to 0 days will result in immediate deletion of
codespaces when stopped or when they timeout due to inactivity.  For more
details, refer to "Setting your timeout period for GitHub Codespaces."

**Save Changes:**

- Click "Save" to apply the new retention period.

This allows you to customize how long your codespaces are kept before automatic
deletion, balancing convenience and storage management.

**Auto Delete Codespace:**

- Go to the "Your codespaces" page at
  [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces).
- Find the codespace you want to exempt from deletion.
- Click the options menu (three dots) to the right of the codespace.
- Select "Auto Delete Codespace" from the dropdown menu. The bookmarked
  codespaces will not be auto-deleted.
