### Starting a Gitpod Workspace

1. **Log In:** Go to the [Gitpod login page](https://gitpod.io/login/) and sign
in with your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account. This allows Gitpod to create
workspaces from your repositories.

2. **Create a workspace using the R Dev Container repo:** Click the Gitpod badge
below to open the Gitpod workspace creation dialog with the relevant options
pre-filled:

    <figure markdown="span"> [![Open in
    Gitpod](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Open%20in%20Gitpod-blue?logo=gitpod&style=for-the-badge)](https://gitpod.io/github.com/r-devel/r-dev-env/tree/main){:target="_blank"}
    </figure>

    <figure markdown="span"> ![start gitpod
    workspace](../../assets/gitpod1.png){width="70%"} </figure>

    Click the "Continue" button in the Gitpod dialog to create a workspace. It
    will take approximately 15-20 minutes to create the workspace for the first
    time. The environment will be cached for faster startup in the future.

    !!! Note Changing the resource option from Standard to Large will reduce the
        free monthly Gitpod usage, which is 50 hours per month of Standard
        workspace usage. See the
        [billing](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/billing) docs for more
        information.
