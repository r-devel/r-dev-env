### Stopping a Gitpod Workspace

1. **Locate the Gitpod Command Palette Button:** To stop the current workspace,
look for the orange Gitpod command palette button in the bottom left corner of
the workspace.

    !!! Note Stopping a workspace will save its state, so you can resume later
        without losing your progress.

### Restarting a Gitpod Workspace

1. **Open Gitpod Dashboard:** Once you're in the Gitpod dashboard, navigate to
the "Workspaces" section. In the "Workspaces" section, you will see a list of
your current and past workspaces. Locate the workspace you want to
restart. Stopped workspaces will have an indicator showing they are not running.

2. **Restart the Workspace:** To restart a workspace, click on the workspace in
the list you want to restart. This will launch the workspace, restoring it to
the state it was in when it was last stopped.

### Managing and Sustaining Codespaces

#### Gitpod Workspace Pinning

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->

**Purpose:** Workspace pinning prevents important workspaces from being
automatically deleted.

**Pinned Workspace:** A workspace that has been pinned will never be deleted,
regardless of inactivity or other automated processes.

**How to Pin:**

- Navigate to your workspace list in the Gitpod dashboard.
- Identify the workspace you want to keep permanently.
- Pin the workspace to ensure it remains available and is not subject to
deletion.  ![manage gitpod workspace](../../assets/manage_workspace.png)

**Benefits:**

Protects critical projects or environments from accidental loss.  Ensures
long-term availability of specific workspaces that you frequently use or need to
preserve.
