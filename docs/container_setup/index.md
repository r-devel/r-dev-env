# Container Setup

You can run the R Dev Container in one of the ways:

- **GitHub Codespaces**: Offers 60 hours per month of free usage for 2-core
  set-ups and 15GB of free storage. The R Dev Container codespace is set up to
  use 4 cores by default, which gives users 30 hours per month of free
  usage. Check out the [Codespace pricing
  docs](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#about-github-codespaces-pricing)
  for more information.

- **Gitpod Workspaces**: Offers 50 hours per month of free usage. Check out the
  [Gitpod pricing docs](https://www.gitpod.io/pricing) for more information.

- **Local Setup**: Currently recommended for Linux users only.

Explore the sub-sections for detailed instructions on setting up and using the
container for each option.
