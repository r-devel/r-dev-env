# Container Setup

You can run the R Dev Container in one of the ways:

- **[GitHub Codespace](github_codespace/creating_codespace.md)**:
  Offers 60 hours per month of free usage for 2-core set-ups and
  15GB of free storage. The R Dev Container codespace is set up
  to use 4 cores by default, which gives users 30 hours per month
  of free usage. Check out the [Codespace pricing docs](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#about-github-codespaces-pricing)
  for more information.

- **[Gitpod Workspace](gitpod_workspace/workspacestart.md)**:
  Offers 50 hours per month of free usage. Check out the
  [Gitpod pricing docs](https://www.gitpod.io/pricing) for more information.

- **[Local Setup](local_setup/localsetup.md)**: Currently recommended
  for Linux users only.

Explore the sub-sections for detailed instructions on setting up and using the
container for each option.
