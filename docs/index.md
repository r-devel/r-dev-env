# R Dev Container

## Project Background

The standard development process used by members of the R Core Team involves an
iterative process of making changes to the source code, re-building R and
exploring/testing the changes made. This process presents a big hurdle for new
contributors to R, as setting up their system to build R can be non-trivial,
requiring a lot of trouble-shooting, especially on Windows and macOS. On Linux
and macOS, it is not straight-forward to work with different versions of R
side-by-side and care needs to be taken not to corrupt or over-write the user's
existing version of R/R packages.

For these reasons, we propose to create containerized development environments
for R. Our focus will be on creating a complete environment, including an IDE,
that will provide a familiar space for R developers to work on contributions to
base R.
