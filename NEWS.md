## R Development Container 0.3

- Implemented Gitpod setup with GitHub Actions workflow to build Docker images
  for the Gitpod workspace.
- Improved `which_r` script with version choice validation and updated both
  `which_r` and `set_build_r` scripts for enhanced functionality.
- Resolved local setup permission issues to ensure smoother operation within the
  devcontainer environment on Linux.
- Restructured documentation to incorporate Gitpod alternative setup.
- Implemented a workflow to optimize images so that documentation files are more
  lightweight.

## R Development Container 0.2

- Documentation split into set of markdown files. These are used to create the
  documentation website <https://contributor.r-project.org/r-dev-env/> and the
  user-focused pages can be accessed directly within the codespace, linked from
  an index that opens when the codespace first starts. New documentation
  pages/topics:
  - Restarting and stopping the codespace
  - Live Share
  - Local Setup
  - Updating Source Code
  - Creating a patch file
  - Multiple R Versions
  - SVN Help
  - Contributor Guide (for R Dev Container itself)
  - Troubleshooting
- Building R documentation now instructs to build R with recommended packages as
  it only takes a few more minutes to set up and enables all the tests to be run
  with `make check`.
- Updated GitHub Actions, so that the container is rebuilt twice a month with
  updated software, including the latest version of R.
- Disconnected Codespace from r-dev-env GitHub repository, so changes are not
  tracked as changes to code for the container itself.
- Updated Codespace settings so that checkouts of the R sources are recognised
  as Subversion repositories, connecting to VS Code version control tab.
- Updated Codespace settings so that the R code linter is turned off (cannot
  define linter for base R!)
- Enabled httpgd graphics device to replace the default of plotting to PNG.
- Modified the default settings of `$BUILDDIR` and `$TOP_SRCDIR` to give a more
  logical setup for working with multiple R versions.
- Added `which_r` script to set the R version to use in R terminals, rather than
  using `sudo make install` to overwrite installed R release version.
- Added `set_build_r` bash function to facilitate custom settings of `$BUILDDIR`
  and `$TOP_SRCDIR` for working with multiple R versions.

## R Development Container 0.1

First version of the R Development Container, including:

- DevContainer definition for creating a codespace allowing users to build R in
  a web based environment
- Instructions for building the current version of R from the SVN trunk within
  the DevContainer in the README.md file
- Contributor workflow instructions in the README.md file
- Docker image build from the dev-container branch which contains the
  requirements for building base R. The image is available from
  <https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-env/pkgs/container/r-dev-env>
